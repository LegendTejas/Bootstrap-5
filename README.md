## Step-by-Step Instructions
---
### 1. Installation

#### I. Download Compiled CSS and JS

- First visit this site: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/
- From there download Compiled CSS and JS and extract all into a new folder named bootstrap or anything of your choice
- Then create an index.html file and type this code:
.............................................

When you open the browser you can see the text style is different.
- This is how we can use compiled css and js code for Bootstrap v5.0.2 to easily drop into your project.

#### II. npm installation

**1. Check if Node.js is installed**

Run in your terminal:
```
node -v
```

If it also says command not found, then Node.js isn't installed.

**2. Install Node.js**

- Go to https://nodejs.org/
- Download the LTS (Recommended) version for your OS
- Install it (npm comes bundled with Node.js).

**3. Verify Installation**

After installation, restart your terminal and run:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

Both should give version numbers.

**4. If still not recognized (Windows PATH issue)**

Sometimes the installer doesn’t add Node.js to PATH.

You need to manually add it:

  1. Open Environment Variables (search in Start menu).
  
  2.Under System variables → Path → Edit
  
  3. Add the path to Node.js installation, e.g.:
  ```
  C:\Program Files\nodejs\
  ```
  
  4. Save, close, and restart terminal.

**5. Now create a folder inside bootstrap folder named "NPM" then open it in VS Code and type these comands in the terminal:**

```
npm init
```

```
package name: (npm) bootstrap-npm
```
Then press Enter multiple times and then type this command:
```
npm install bootstrap
```
Install popper js as well and then you can link it to your project later:
```
npm install @popperjs/core --save
```
**7. Now Create an index.html file in NPM folder and type this code: **
